# Session 2: Core Concepts - Session Notes

**Learner:** Sacrtap (QA, Beginner)
**Completed:** 2026-02-25
**Score:** 100/100
**Duration:** 45 min

## Session Objectives

- Understand testing as engineering philosophy
- Learn risk-based testing with P0-P3 matrix
- Master TEA Definition of Done (quality standards)
- Understand probability × impact risk scoring

---

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Testing as Engineering

- Tests are designed before written (like architecture)
- Tests have quality standards (not just "does it run?")
- Tests are maintained like production code
- Testing decisions are risk-based

**For QA Engineers:** Engineering test systems that scale, not just finding bugs.

### 2. Risk-Based Testing: P0-P3 Matrix

**P0 - Critical (Must Test):** Login, authentication, payment, data loss, security
**P1 - High (Should Test):** Core workflows, key features, data integrity
**P2 - Medium (Nice to Test):** Secondary features, edge cases with workarounds
**P3 - Low (Optional):** Tooltips, help text, nice-to-have features

**Formula:** Risk = Probability × Impact

### 3. TEA Definition of Done

**7 Quality Standards:**

1. No flaky tests (deterministic pass/fail)
2. No hard waits/sleeps (use waitFor conditions)
3. Stateless & parallelizable
4. No order dependency
5. Self-cleaning tests (auto cleanup data)
6. Tests live near source code
7. Low maintenance

### Questions & Answers

1. Login/authentication priority level? → D (P0 - Critical) ✓
2. Problem with sleep(5000) vs waitFor? → B (Hard wait, violates DoD) ✓
3. Self-cleaning tests meaning? → B (Delete/deactivate created entities) ✓

## Key Takeaways

- Testing is engineering discipline, not afterthought
- P0-P3 matrix prioritizes testing based on business impact
- Definition of Done ensures reliable, maintainable tests
- Quality standards prevent "test maintenance nightmare"
- For QA: Use P0-P3 to defend coverage decisions
